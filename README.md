# Assignment-1
This project is about a website for a fictional company. The company that I have chosen for the project is called Bandit Records.
It is a Music Label that mainly specializes in distributing music in the Artcore Genre of Music, which is mainly used in Rhythm Games.
The main purpose of the website is to allow users to download the music that the label distributes, giving some history about the company, or contacting the website to join the label or confirm any queries.

# Design Process

## Theme, color scheme and fonts
For this website, I wanted to have a theme that is extremely simple. The kind of user that would most likely be visiting the website 
would be trying to find out about the company or trying to join the label. If that is the case, the website should be easy to navigate while also being easy to read. 

As a fan of the label who wants to learn more about it, I would want the text on the website to be legible in order to read it clearly and understand what the content is trying to convey.

That is why for the website, I decided to make it black as it is a neutral color that is extremely simple. For the text, I decided to make it white so that it contrast with the black. It is also a good color scheme which makes it look better to look at. For the fonts I used 2. One for the text to be read and one that looks better for other text that isn't as important. This is so that the user will be able to see the content that is meant to be read clearer.

## Navigation

As a producer who is trying to join the label, I want the website to have easy navigation in order to find the contact information and possibly get into contact with the label to join. 

For the navigation across the webpages, I decided to use headers and footers as the main means of navigating across the webpages. This makes finding the navigation links easy. That way the user can easily navigate across the pages whether they are at the top of the website or the bottom of the website.

# Features

## index.html

The first section and what the user will see first when opening the website.

### About

When the user finds the website, the first thing they will see is a message that welcomes the user. This is to give a proper introduction to the user if they are new to the label or the website itself. It also shows some information about what the website has to offer so that the user will know what they will find in the website.

### Song, Playlist and Artist Showcase

This section is to showcase the various Songs that have been released on the label. There are three songs that can be seen in the song section. Whenever the user hovers their mouse onto the song covers, a snippet of the song will play, which will give a more interactive feel.

Next is playlists, these are to showcase the different playlist that are on the label.

For both of these sections, whenever you hover your mouse onto the images, they will scale larger, making it more interactive. Whenever a song or playlist isn't released yet, they will not play any sounds.

The last section is the artists. These will show the various artists who have released on the label.

### Joining the label and submitting a demo

If a user would like to join the label. They can do so by sending a demo to the label and the label can check to see if you are legible.

### Sending a message

# Technologies Used

The main technologies I used in making this website is programming languages and imported fonts and logos

## Languages Used

I used HTML to make the main content and structure of the whole website, which is all the words, audio, images and links that the user can interact with.

I used CSS to make the webpages a different color, which is black and white. I also used it to make the content be placed in a specific way in order to make it look more readable.

Lastly, I used JavaScript addEventListener to make it so that when you hover over the songs on the webpage, it plays the song that is associated with the song cover.

## imported assets

I imported all the fonts from Google Fonts and I imported the logos from a website called Awesome Fonts
