                    Bandit Records was first founded in 2021 by EDM Producer Star Bandit. Star Bandit is a Singaporean Artist who started
                    gaining popularity after many of his tracks were featured in the Sound Voltex Franchise. Being extremely passionate about
                    Rhythm Game Music, he decided to start his own label that is mainly directed at promoting Rhythm Game Music in an attempt to
                    not only open the world up to it, but to also meet other producers who feel the same way about rhythm game music.

                <p>
                    "Before I started releasing my music on Bandit Records, I was an extremely small producer who was mainly releasing 
                    on sites such as Newgrounds. I am a huge rhythm game fan and it was one of the reasons that I started producing music.
                    When I first heard about Bandit Records, I was intrigued by it's concept. When I joined, I met a community who had the same amount of joy that I have when it came to 
                    rhythm games. My experience started to become more positive when I started releasing my music there, with a lot of love
                    from the community about how my music was what they had been looking for. Bandit Records is definitely a rare sight to behold and I have no regrets joining."
